# Archodi
Archodi is instant Kodi Media Center on Pendrive you can boot to computer, 
so you don't need to dirty your hand installing and configuring, 
build from ArchLinux amd64.

# Download
For this moment, I can only upload the disk image on my telegram channel [http://telegram.me/halamanbelakang](http://telegram.me/halamanbelakang), you can find the file on shared media.

# Installation
Just flash your pen drive (`4GB at least`) with Archodi disk image. You can use `dd` or `Win32DiskImager`
